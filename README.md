# Antarec

## Masterâ€™s Final Project (MFP)

This Android App corresponds to my Master's final project. 

This app is usefull for the people who loves to travel and they like to plann ahead or just keep track of the different places which they visit or places that they loves, or good restaurants to have a meal.

## How Antarec Works

While travelling you want to write down the different things you see or you experience, then you should create a travel from the main window using the floating button.

When the Header Trip screen is displayed you can start filling it, with the title of the treep, the dates between you travel, the number of persons that are travelling and their names or info about them. Also you can set up a place using the map of the screen.

Once is done you can save the trip using the upper save button, and then select the option Trip Days from the Menu.

On the Trip Days screen you can select or change the date displayed and then start writing your blog. You can also attach pictures using the menu, or attach a Restaurant that you liked or want to go. Also you can add a new day to your trip and save the current date so the changes are not lost. You can also delete a whole day if you don't like it.

If you go back to the main screen once the trip is finished, you can see it on the list, from there you can select the trip to edit it, or you can longpress the trip and delete it using the main screen menu.
